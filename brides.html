  		We've been creating our gorgeous bridal shoes for just over a year now. I am very 
   		excited that we can finally start looking back at some of the amazing weddings over 
   		the past season that Love Art Wear Art played a tiny role in! We would like to share 
   		a few snapshots of some of our lovely brides, their grooms & their wedding days. 
   		It is so nice to see all the detailed plans come together on the day. For me it's 
   		very special when someone chooses our shoes to finish of their outfit. So its with 
   		pride and joy that we share these lovely moments with you.

  		Danielle and Josh had their wedding in the green and leafy Greenwhich. Danielle wore a beautiful beaded gown 
  		by Charlotte Wilden Bride. She teamed this elegant dress with our <a href="http://loveartwearart.com/anoush-suede-wedding-shoes.html" 
  		target="_blank" title="">Anoush</a> white & silver suede platform peep toe sandals. 
  		<br><br>
  		Danielle: "I really struggled to find anything that I wanted to wear let alone that I could justify paying paying the sometimes eye watering prices for however in my extensive 
  		search I came across a photo shoot and loved the shoes on the model. I was therefore delighted when I found that not only was I able to find them online, the price was reasonable. As much as I 
  		needed my shoes to have as high a heel as possible (my husband is 6 foot 8) I was taking the 'bury my head in the sand' approach to how much my feet were going to ache wearing them however I can 
  		honestly say that these shoes were the most comfortable heels I have ever worn. I managed 11am to 10pm which to me makes them worth every penny. Thank you so much Nicole, I look forward to finding 
  		any excuse possible to get them out again!”

  		Raithwaite Estate, Whitby. 
  		<br><br>
  		Sharice: "My Kunja White heels were the most beautiful and comfortable pair of 
  		shoes I have had the pleasure of wearing. I have M.E. and have a lot of pain to 
  		contend with on a daily basis so heels are something of a rarity for me nowadays 
  		but these heels were still comfortable when I took them off after about 15 hours 
  		of wearing them. It's really hard to find comfortable wedding heels that look so 
  		beautiful! The grounds of our venue was extensive so we had a lot of walking to 
  		do and our 1950s rock and roll band at the evening reception meant a lot of dancing 
  		so these heels were well and truly tested for the comfort factor! But as well as 
  		being the comfiest heels ever they were truly stunning and got lots of compliments." 
  		<br><br>
  		Sharice wore our <a href="http://shop.loveartwearart.com/collections/bridal/products/bridal-kunja-white" target="_blank" title="">Kunja </a> wrap around peep toes with a glittery heel.

  		sparkly t-bar sandal and to quote her: "My Carmen Ivory Shoes are my favourite 
  		shoes ever!! It was very warm and the shoes were the most perfect choice. They 
  		were airy so I felt really light in them.... but so pretty and vintage looking 
  		at the same time. I managed to dance the whole night away in them with all of my 
  		old school friends, which is a memory I will never forget." 
  		<br><br>
  		The wedding was vintage/great gatsby inspired. Emma wore a beautiful Jenny Packham 
  		Willow Dress and "borrowed" art deco style chandelier earrings. One of my favourite
