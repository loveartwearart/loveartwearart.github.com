  		We've been creating our gorgeous bridal shoes for about 5 years and I love nothing more than receiving photos and feedback from our happy brides. 
  		It's great to look at the photos of their splendid days and I feel a great pleasure to know that Love Art Wear Art played a small role in each one! 
  		We would like to share a few snapshots of some of our lovely brides, their dashing grooms & beautiful wedding days. It is so nice to see all the detailed 
  		plans come together on the day filled with family friends and a lot of smiles. It is an honour when someone chooses our shoes to finish of their outfit,<br> 
  		so it's with pride and joy that we share these lovely moments with you.

  		<br><br>
  		Susanne: "I really still love my shoes and they were perfect to wear, like slippers ;) luxury slippers. I was looking for extraordinary shoes to pimp up my style. It was love at first sight, 
  		when I found this beautiful and unique shoes on Pinterest. It was extreamly easy & uncomlicated to order the shoes per email. Perfect and confortable shoes for a unforgettable day with my

  		Dana & Mario got married on the 20th of May this year in their hometown in Nothern Germany, just outside of Hamburg. They had a lovely, sunny day (which can be very rare there) to exchange our “I do’s”

  		<br><br>
  		Dana: "The shoes were all I could ask for on my wedding day: sparkly, comfy and with the right height to move around jauntily. For every bride-to-be, I can totally recommend a shoe that does not only 
  		fit the dress but also one that you can wear all day long without having to change into the emergency ballerinas when the party is in full swing. For me the Scarlett shoes definitely did the trick."

  		Danielle: "I really struggled to find anything that I wanted to wear let alone that I could justify paying paying the sometimes eye watering prices for however in my extensive 
  		search I came across a photo shoot and loved the shoes on the model. I was therefore delighted when I found that not only was I able to find them online, the price was reasonable. As much as I 
  		needed my shoes to have as high a heel as possible (my husband is 6 foot 8) I was taking the 'bury my head in the sand' approach to how much my feet were going to ache wearing them however I can 
  		honestly say that these shoes were the most comfortable heels I have ever worn. I managed 11am to 10pm which to me makes them worth every penny. Thank you so much Nicole, I look forward to finding 
  		any excuse possible to get them out again!”

  		but these heels were still comfortable when I took them off after about 15 hours 
  		of wearing them. It's really hard to find comfortable wedding heels that look so 
  		beautiful! The grounds of our venue was extensive so we had a lot of walking to 
  		do and our 1950s rock and roll band at the evening reception meant a lot of dancing 
  		so these heels were well and truly tested for the comfort factor! But as well as 
  		being the comfiest heels ever they were truly stunning and got lots of compliments."

  		at the same time. I managed to dance the whole night away in them with all of my
