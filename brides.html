  		We've been creating our gorgeous bridal shoes for just over a year now. I am very 
   		excited that we can finally start looking back at some of the amazing weddings over 
   		the past season that Love Art Wear Art played a tiny role in! We would like to share 
   		a few snapshots of some of our lovely brides, their grooms & their wedding days. 
   		It is so nice to see all the detailed plans come together on the day. For me it's 
   		very special when someone chooses our shoes to finish of their outfit. So its with 
   		pride and joy that we share these lovely moments with you.

  		Summer 2014 was a busy bridal season and another of our lovely couples are Emma & Chris Turner. 
  		Their wedding was Friday 6th June 2014 at Iscoyd Park in Whitchurch Shropshire. 
  		<br><br>
  		They were lucky and had an amazingly sunny day. Emma wore our <a href="http://shop.loveartwearart.com/collections/bridal/products/carmen-ivory-80mm-1" target="_blank" title="">Carmen Ivory</a> 
  		sparkly t-bar sandal and to quote her: "My Carmen Ivory Shoes are my favourite 
  		shoes ever!! It was very warm and the shoes were the most perfect choice. They 
  		were airy so I felt really light in them.... but so pretty and vintage looking 
  		at the same time. I managed to dance the whole night away in them with all of my 
  		old school friends, which is a memory I will never forget." 
  		<br><br>
  		The wedding was vintage/great gatsby inspired. Emma wore a beautiful Jenny Packham 
  		Willow Dress and "borrowed" art deco style chandelier earrings. One of my favourite 
  		photos is of her daughter, she loved the shoes too and kept trying to put them on! 
  		What a cutie, love the heart shaped sunnies, must get some stat!

  		Sharice and Matthew Hartley were married on the 6th of September 2014 at the beautiful 
  		Raithwaite Estate, Whitby. 
  		<br><br>
  		Sharice: "My Kunja White heels were the most beautiful and comfortable pair of 
  		shoes I have had the pleasure of wearing. I have M.E. and have a lot of pain to 
  		contend with on a daily basis so heels are something of a rarity for me nowadays 
  		but these heels were still comfortable when I took them off after about 15 hours 
  		of wearing them. It's really hard to find comfortable wedding heels that look so 
  		beautiful! The grounds of our venue was extensive so we had a lot of walking to 
  		do and our 1950s rock and roll band at the evening reception meant a lot of dancing 
  		so these heels were well and truly tested for the comfort factor! But as well as 
  		being the comfiest heels ever they were truly stunning and got lots of compliments." 
  		<br><br>
  		Sharice wore our <a href="http://shop.loveartwearart.com/collections/bridal/products/bridal-kunja-white" target="_blank" title="">Kunja </a> wrap around peep toes with a glittery heel.

  		"I stumbled across the beautiful Love Art Wear Art shoes whilst obsessively perusing instagram 
  		for all things wedding. I quickly searched for the website and immediately loved the range of shoes 
  		on offer. I was conscious that I wanted to try various different styles before committing to one. 
  		Nicole was so accommodating from the start; she sent me various alternative photos of the styles I 
  		liked and advised on how the shoes fit. Nicole really did make the process easy; her customer service 
  		is second to none. Furthermore, her shoes are so beautiful and just that little bit different whilst 
  		still looking elegant and classy."
