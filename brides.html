  		We've been creating our gorgeous bridal shoes for just over a year now. I am very 
   		excited that we can finally start looking back at some of the amazing weddings over 
   		the past season that Love Art Wear Art played a tiny role in! We would like to share 
   		a few snapshots of some of our lovely brides, their grooms & their wedding days. 
   		It is so nice to see all the detailed plans come together on the day. For me it's 
   		very special when someone chooses our shoes to finish of their outfit. So its with 
   		pride and joy that we share these lovely moments with you.

  		Mrs Beccy Austin and Dr Ed Austin got married on the 6th of July last year and the 
   		weather was amazing! The ceremony was in St Edward's Church in Netley Abbey, Hampshire 
   		and the reception at Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley. Beccy looked stunning in her 
   		long, floaty, ivory dress. Our <a href="http://shop.loveartwearart.com/collections/bridal/products/scarlett-ivory" target="_blank" title="">Scarlett Ivory</a> t-bar dance shoe was the perfect fit!
   		<br><br>
   		<i>Beccy: "The shoes were amazing. So comfortable I wore them right up to the last bit of 
   		the night. I still love them and I'm hoping to wear them to my sisters wedding in a months 
   		time. Thank you so much!"</i>
   		<br><br>
   		We love the bottom photo of the bridal shoes, garter and family photos on the mantle piece. 
		Lots of family history and love in one photo! It shows the shoes, the garter which her 
		Granny handmade out of lace, and family wedding photos. Parents, grand parents and great 
		grand parents!

  		Catherine & Stephen got married at Hampton Court House, East Molesey on the 20th December 2013. The loose theme was vintage Hollywood glamour... so our 
   		<a href="http://shop.loveartwearart.com/collections/bridal/products/scarlett-ivory" target="_blank" title="">Scarlett Ivory</a> was perfect for the occasion. What a beautiful and old school glamorous wedding!
