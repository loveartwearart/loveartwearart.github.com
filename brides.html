  		We've been creating our gorgeous bridal shoes for just over a year now. I am very 
   		excited that we can finally start looking back at some of the amazing weddings over 
   		the past season that Love Art Wear Art played a tiny role in! We would like to share 
   		a few snapshots of some of our lovely brides, their grooms & their wedding days. 
   		It is so nice to see all the detailed plans come together on the day. For me it's 
   		very special when someone chooses our shoes to finish of their outfit. So its with 
   		pride and joy that we share these lovely moments with you.
