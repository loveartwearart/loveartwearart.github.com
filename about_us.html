  		<h3>About Love Art Wear Art</h3>
      	<div class="subtitle">Love Art Wear Art creates beautiful, limited edition, handmade shoes for shoe lovers that appreciate quality & uniqueness.</div>
    	<p>
    	The Love Art Wear Art collection is a luxury bridal footwear collection that offers limited edition shoes to the discerning bridal market. 
    	LAWA aims to marry the spirit of glamorous eras gone by with a unique contemporary twist introduced through subtle detail and tasteful styling. 
    	LAWA shoes are timeless, elegant and unique pieces that don't follow trends. Textures & luxury materials are key. Our styles incorporate a playful 
    	mix of Italian & Spanish sourced satin, kid skin, metallic leather, glitter leather and metal hardware details.

    	<p>
    	Your comfort is very important to us, we want to make sure our brides can wear their shoes all day long. We put an extra layer of rubber foam on all 
    	our insoles to offer a soft padded sock. The shoes are leather lined so moves and breathes with you. Each pair is hand stitched and lasted in Spain. 
    	We pride ourselves on our attention to detail, quality and excellent customer care, so get in touch to find your perfect pair!
