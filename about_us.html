    so that we can guarantee you will be wearing something unique. For the SS11 Nika range there are only 50 pairs of
    each style. Each pair is individually numbered by a little metal banner on the outsole</p>

    dynamic silhouettes using high quality materials & interesting embellishments.</p>
