    <p>Armed with an undisputable talent for design, a keen eye for detail & embellishment and natural creativity, South African born 
    Nicole le Grange creates her luxurious collection of limited edition, beautiful and unique footwear.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="quote2">All Love Art Wear Art shoes are created as part of limited ranges. We produce limited runs of each style & colour
    so that we can guarantee you will be wearing something unique. For the SS11 Nika range there are only 50 pairs of
    each style. Each pair is individually numbered by a little metal banner on the outsole.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Feel feminine and playful in the latest AW13 Collection, this beautifully crafted range of vintage inspired shoes and ankle boots. Oversized bows, 
	ties & tassels, delicate heart punch panels and playfully scalloped toplines with delicate brogue detail make for an elegant and fun
	range. Colour blocking in a tasteful pallet using luxurious leathers & suedes adds a modern element while the attention to detail and
	old school craftsmanship shines through in the design.</p>
	<br>
    <p>Love Art Wear Art shoes offer a combination of uniqueness, comfort and beautiful design. Have a look around our world, inspiration &
    products. We hope you like what you see.</p>
